cookiecutter-roboto-actions
===========================

Project templates for initializing Roboto Actions.

### Development
* `make install` to build the project locally
* `make fmt && make lint` before pushing a commit

### Testing
Run: `.venv/bin/cookiecutter --output-dir <some-temp-dir> .`

This will walk you through the workflow of creating a new action, same as `roboto actions init`.
